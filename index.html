						<h5>About Me</h5>
							<p>
								I am a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign working with Prof. Brian Bailey in the ORCHID Research Group. My current research interests include the online representation of product design, creativity tools, and educational technologies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Before coming to UIUC, I completed my BS in Computer Science from Oregon State University. There, I worked with Prof. Rebecca Hutchinson and Prof. Thomas Dietterich for my undergraduate senior thesis. 
							</p>
<!-- 							<p>
								My current interests are in reseearching educational technologies for design domains and representations of design history from a basis of psycology and sociology. My past research focused on novel features for online tools to facilitate peer feedback and best practices to implement peer feedback in large classrooms. I am interested in continuing work to support the ideation and iteration phases of the design process and look forward to further integrating theory into online practices and tools to develop a better learning experience.

							<h5>Why Should I Write Feedback? Increasing Quality and Involvement in Online Peer Feedback Exchange</h5>
							<h6>Sneha R. Krishna Kumaran, Deana McDonagh, Brian P. Bailey</h6>
							<h6>CSCW 2018--Online First (27%) <a href="papers/cscw18_cameraready.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></h6>
							<p> Instructors  are  integrating  the  use  of  online  peer  review platforms to  keep pace  with  growing class sizes. However, these platforms typically prioritize random peer assignment and only show the current solution. These choices can result in low quality feedback in project-based design courses. We report  on  an  experiment  in  which  students  (N=59)  worked on twelve-week product design projects and both wrote and received  online  feedback  at  four  stages.  The  experiment tested  a  novel  concept  of peer  mentorship,where  peers were assigned to give feedback to all stages of one project, and  tested  showing  feedback  context  from  the  preceding design stage when composing feedback. The results showed that displaying context from the preceding design stage led to  feedback  with  higher  perceived  quality  at  certain  stages of the design process and feedback from mentors promotes more   response   from   the   feedback   receiver.   Our   work contributes    deeper    empirical    understanding    of    how assignment   strategies   and   showing   additional   context affects  peer  feedback  and  provides  practical  guidelines  for instructors to implement these methods in design courses. </p>

							<h5>SAGE DesignBot</h5>
							<h6>Class Project for Into to Human Computer Interaction (CS 565)</h6>
							<p>
								People often refer to various sources for receiving feedback on their designs including online platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, Behance, expert designers, friends, family, etc. One of our goals was to see if a bot designed to provide feedback would be able to overcome the limitations of those venues of feedback. To do this, we performed a wizard-of-OZ user study to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a potential design bot. Participants were more comfortable interacting with the bot compared to an online community. Participants also noted that they would prefer to get face-to-face feedback at certain stages of the design process. Our results suggest that a design bot will be an useful tool for novice designers who are looking to get feedback.

							<h5>Determining fashion styles from Non-relevant domains</h5>
							<h6>Class Project for Data-Driven Design (CS 598 RK)</h6>
							<p>
								Our results show that it is promising to use domains such as personality to gain useful knowledge about a person. This will allow applications to be able to onboard users faster without tedious manual inputs of a user’s wardrobe or the access of sensitive materials such as receipts. *Add stuff about method, data modeling and results here*. So far, our results show us that we can use non-sensitive, distant domains to learn about a user’s preferences when the question is framed in the correct manner. Our project also shows potential to grow and provide further contributions.

							<h5>Identifying a ranking of plant preferences for a pollinator</h5>
							<h6>Sneha R. Krishna Kumaran, Thomas Dietterich, Rebecca Hutchinson</h6>
							<h6>Undergraduate Research Project <a href="papers/KrishnaSnehaR2015.pdf" target = "_blank">Thesis</a></h6>
							<p>
								Pollinators are an integral part of agriculture and the ecosystem. However, due to changing land use, populations of wild pollinators are decreasing and plant distributions are changing all around the world. To understand how plant-pollinator networks will adapt over time, we would like to understand how pollinators choose flowers to visit. We will model a pollinator’s interaction with plant species in two ways: first using a probabilistic multinomial approach to fit a preference score to each plant and second to explain our findings from the multinomial model using the traits of the flowers themselves. Our findings show that a model with preferences performs better than a model which does not have preferences. While this model shows potential in finding plant preferences, it does not fully explain the distribution of plant-pollinator interactions. To try to explain the interactions more fully, we incorporated the traits of the plants into the score of the plant. We found that the traits do have some effect on the score of the plant, but again do not fully explain the interactions in this particular model.
